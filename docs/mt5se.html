<big style="font-weight: bold;"><big><br>
<big>Let's talk about Autonomous Traders</big></big></big><br>
<br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><br>
<big>There are many initiatative that try to create software able to
buy and sell financial assets (stock, foreign exchanges, etc) in an
autonomous way.&nbsp; There are some digital platforms that allow
thedevelopment,&nbsp; test&nbsp; and&nbsp; deployment&nbsp; of&nbsp;
trading&nbsp; agents&nbsp; (or&nbsp; robots)in simulated or real
markets. <br>
<br>
In fact, autonomous trading robots have&nbsp; been&nbsp; studied&nbsp;
in&nbsp; artificial&nbsp; intelligence&nbsp; area&nbsp; for&nbsp;
some&nbsp; time. Some&nbsp; of&nbsp; these&nbsp; work&nbsp; focus&nbsp;
on&nbsp; very&nbsp; short&nbsp; horizons&nbsp; of&nbsp; investment
(often called high&nbsp; frequency&nbsp; trading),&nbsp; while&nbsp;
others&nbsp; deal&nbsp; with&nbsp; longer&nbsp; periods.<br>
<br>
These&nbsp; autonomous&nbsp; strategies&nbsp; may be created with some
simple idea (moving averages, for instance), or more complex approaches
including the use of complex Artificial Intelligence algorithms.&nbsp;
The&nbsp; spectrum&nbsp; of&nbsp; used&nbsp; AI&nbsp; techniques&nbsp;
in&nbsp; finance&nbsp; field&nbsp; is&nbsp; wide and it includes more
recent approaches like convolutional neuralnetworks and deep
reinforcement learning.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
There are many cases, where&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp;
developers&nbsp; are successful&nbsp; in creating&nbsp;&nbsp;
robots&nbsp;&nbsp; with great&nbsp; performance&nbsp; when&nbsp;
executing&nbsp; with&nbsp; historical&nbsp; price&nbsp; series
(so&nbsp; called&nbsp; backtesting).&nbsp; Furthermore,&nbsp;
some&nbsp; electronic&nbsp; platforms make&nbsp; available&nbsp;
thousands&nbsp; of&nbsp; robots&nbsp; that&nbsp; [allegedly]&nbsp;
are&nbsp; able to be&nbsp; profitable&nbsp; in&nbsp; real&nbsp;
markets.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Nevertheless, when these&nbsp; robots&nbsp; are&nbsp; used&nbsp;
in&nbsp; real&nbsp; markets&nbsp; (or&nbsp; data&nbsp; not&nbsp;
used&nbsp; intheir&nbsp; training&nbsp; or&nbsp; evaluation)&nbsp;
frequently&nbsp; they&nbsp; present&nbsp; very&nbsp; poor
performance&nbsp; and&nbsp; high&nbsp; variance&nbsp; of&nbsp; returns.
<br>
<br>
Building Reliable Autonomous Traders is a VERY complex task that require dealing with several challenging, as we will see...<br>
</big><br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><big><big><span style="font-weight: bold;">Algortitms that can invest [ better than people] ?? </span></big></big><br>
<big><br>
&ldquo;<span style="font-style: italic;">Few people have what it takes
to be great investors. Some can be taught, but not everyone . . . and
those who can be taught can&rsquo;t be taught everything. </span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">Valid approaches work some of the time but not all. And </span><big style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">investing can&rsquo;t be reduced to an algorithm and turned over to a computer.</span></big><span style="font-style: italic;"> Even the best investors don&rsquo;t get it right every time. </span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">The reasons are simple. No rule
always works. The environment isn&rsquo;t controllable, and
circumstances rarely repeat exactly. </span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">Psychology plays a major role in
markets, and because it&rsquo;s highly variable, cause- and- effect
relationships aren&rsquo;t reliable. An investment approach may work
for a while but eventually the actions it calls for will change the
environment, meaning a new approach is needed. And if others emulate an
approach, that will blunt its effectiveness.</span>&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The most important thing: uncommon sense for the thoughtful investor.

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><big><big><span style="font-weight: bold;">What happens if Algo Traders become ubiquitous?</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
</big></big><br>
<br>
<big><br>
</big>
<ul>
  <li><big>Would everybody become rich or at least present very high average returns on their investments?</big></li>
  <li><big>The short answer is no. </big></li>
  <li><big>We believe the scenario described by Eugene Fama [6] in his Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) would take place. </big></li>
  <li><big>The EMH states that financial markets are efficient in
pricing assets. Asset prices would reflect all information publicly
available and the collective beliefs of all investors over the
foreseeable future. </big></li>
  <li><big>Thus, it would not be possible to overcome the performance
of the market, using information that is known by the market, except
for simple chance</big></li>
</ul>
<br>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><br>
<big><big><big><span style="font-weight: bold;">How hard is Autonomous trading?</span></big></big></big><br>
<br>
<br>
<ul>
  <li><big><big>The environment faced by the autonomous investment analysts could be classified in a classic way as: </big></big></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;">
<ul>
  <li><big><big>partially observable, </big></big></li>
  <li><big><big>sequential, </big></big></li>
  <li><big><big>stochastic, </big></big></li>
  <li><big><big>dynamic, </big></big></li>
  <li><big><big>continuous </big></big></li>
  <li><big><big>and multiagent,</big></big></li>
</ul>
</div>
<ul>
  <li><big><big>Which is the most complex environment class</big></big></li>
  <li><big><big>However, it does not really represents the whole complexity of the problem. </big></big></li>
  <li><big><big>More than stochastic, such environment is also a
non-stationary process (Probability distributions do change along the
time) and it is also strategic in the sense that two traders compete
for a more accurate valuation of assets and their actions may change
other agents&rsquo; behavior.</big></big></li>
</ul>

</big></big>
<ul>
  <li><big><big>Deep Learning</big></big></li>
  <li><big><big>Convolutional neural networks tem apresentado
execelentes resultados no processamento de imagens, mas tamb&eacute;m
em an&aacute;lises de s&eacute;ries temporais (pre&ccedil;o,
volume,etc.) e podem ser muito &uacute;teis na constru&ccedil;&atilde;o
de novos algoritmos </big></big></li>

  <li><big><big>Specially Natural language processing, Sentiment analysis and human-computer interaction</big></big></li>
  <li><big><big>A Small Market (like Brazil) may take more time to
adjust to new information, it gives opportunities to Algo trading to
explore it</big></big></li>

  <li><big>Data&nbsp; Collector: According to theStrategy, there are
setof&nbsp; data&nbsp; points&nbsp; that&nbsp; needs&nbsp; to&nbsp;
be&nbsp; collected&nbsp; and&nbsp; properly stored&nbsp; in&nbsp;
theMarket&nbsp; informationin&nbsp; a&nbsp; continuous&nbsp; way. That
is the role of the Data collector component.</big></li>
  <li><big>Trading Strategy:&nbsp; it&nbsp; is&nbsp; the&nbsp;
implementation&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; function&nbsp; that decides the
Robot&rsquo;s actions according to current portfolio and Market
situation. It can arbirtraly complex and it needs to deal with market
prediction and risk management.</big></li>
  <li><big>Order&nbsp;&nbsp; Processor:&nbsp; Once&nbsp; the Strategy
decides&nbsp; which orders to submit according to the observed Market
information and current portfolio. These orders&nbsp; are&nbsp;
dispatched&nbsp; to&nbsp; some&nbsp; Market&nbsp; (real&nbsp;
orsimulated) by the Order processor component to be completely or
partially executed or even not executed according to the market
conditions. The order processor also&nbsp; updates the&nbsp;
portfolio&nbsp; information&nbsp; according&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp;
result&nbsp; of&nbsp; the submitted orders</big></li>
